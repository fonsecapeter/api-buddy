# API Buddy

> Right now, only OAuth2 authentication is supported. It's the most common, and current gold standard for security best practices. Also most APIs use it. That said, I have no beef with all the APIs out there using something else, so feel free to open a ticket if you want something else supported. ðŸŽŸ

> You can also always manually set headers.

## Installation

As long as you have python 3.7 or higher (I recommend using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)), just:
```bash
pip install api-buddy
```

## Usage

First, specify the API you're exploring in your preferences
```yaml
# ~/.api-buddy.yaml
api_url: https://some.api.com
```

Then it's as easy as:
```bash
api get some-endpoint
```
```json
=> 200
{
  "look": "I haz data",
  "thx": "API Buddy"
}
```

HTTP Method defaults to `get`:
```bash
api this-endpoint  # same as first example
```

You can add query params in key=val format:
```bash
api get \
  my/favorite/endpoint \
  first_name=cosmo \
  last_name=kramer
```

You can also add request body data in JSON format:
```bash
api post \
  some-endpoint \
  '{"id": 1, "field": "value"}'
```

ðŸ¤” Note the single-quotes. You can expand this accross multiple lines:
```bash
api post \
  some-endpoint \
  '{
     "id": 1,
     "field": "value"
  }'
```
